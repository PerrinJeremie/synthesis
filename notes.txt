SSL

a system of deductive synthesis rules, which prescribe how to decompose specifications for complex
programs into specifications for simpler programs, while synthesizing the corresponding computa-
tions compositionally. In essence, SSL is a proof system for a new transformation judgment P { Q| c
(reads as “the assertion P transforms into Q via a program c”), which unifies SL entailment P ⊢ Q
and verification {P} c {Q}, with the former expressible as P { Q| skip .
